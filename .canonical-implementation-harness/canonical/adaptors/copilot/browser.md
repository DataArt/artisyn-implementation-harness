# Browser verification in Copilot

Use only an exposed, authorized browser capability or configured MCP integration.
Do not assume a browser tool exists because of the host name.
Check navigation, interaction, console, network and DOM capabilities separately.
Preserve the skill's origin scope and explicit opt-in; integration permissions do
not widen it. A screenshot does not prove missing DOM or network checks.
If a capability is unavailable, report the affected checks as not verified and
continue the rest of the review. Follow the host's setup procedure when the
developer has authorized enabling an integration.
